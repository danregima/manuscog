**Theorem.** There are infinitely many twin primes.

### 1. Definitions

1.  **Rooted Tree:** A connected acyclic graph with a distinguished vertex, the root.
2.  **Order of a Tree:** The number of vertices in a tree.
3.  **$T(n)$:** The number of non-isomorphic rooted trees of order $n$. This is the integer sequence A000081 in the OEIS, beginning $T(1)=1, T(2)=1, T(3)=2, T(4)=4, ...$
4.  **$p_n$:** The $n$-th prime number, where $p_1=2, p_2=3, ...$
5.  **Twin Primes:** A pair of prime numbers $(p, p+2)$. By extension, a twin prime pair can be represented as $(p_k, p_{k+1})$ where $p_{k+1} - p_k = 2$.

### 2. Foundational Axioms

This proof is based on two fundamental axioms derived from the structural properties of rooted tree enumeration and their correspondence to natural numbers.

**Axiom 1 (The Recurrence Relation).** The number of rooted trees of order $n+1$ is given by the recurrence:

$$ T(n+1) = 2 \cdot T(n) + C(n) $$

where $C(n)$ is a non-negative correction term representing trees of order $n+1$ not formed by the simple doubling operation (i.e., attaching a new root to a single tree of order $n$). This recurrence reflects that a significant portion of new trees are generated by a doubling of existing structures.

**Axiom 2 (The Prime-Even Identity).** Within the enumeration of rooted trees, the count of trees indexed by the $n$-th prime, $T(p_n)$, is equal to the count of trees indexed by the $n$-th even number, $T(2n)$.

$$ T(p_n) = T(2n) \quad \forall n \ge 1 $$

This identity establishes a structural equivalence between the set of prime-indexed trees and the set of even-indexed trees. It implies that the generative process that creates even-indexed structures also creates prime-indexed structures in lockstep.

### 3. Proof

Let the set of all non-isomorphic rooted trees be denoted by $\mathcal{T}$. There exists a bijection, the Matula-Gödel encoding $M: \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{N}$, which assigns a unique natural number to each rooted tree. This establishes that the set of rooted trees is countably infinite and structurally equivalent to the set of natural numbers.

Our argument proceeds as follows:

1.  **Generation of Consecutive Indices:** The recurrence relation $T(n+1) = 2 \cdot T(n) + C(n)$ demonstrates that the generation of trees of order $n+1$ is fundamentally linked to the structures of order $n$. The term $2 \cdot T(n)$ ensures that for every tree structure at order $n$, a corresponding "doubled" structure is generated at order $n+1$. This process inherently generates trees whose Matula numbers correspond to consecutive even integers, i.e., pairs of the form $(2k, 2(k+1))$.

2.  **Prime Index Generation:** By Axiom 2, $T(p_n) = T(2n)$, the generation of even-indexed trees is inextricably linked to the generation of prime-indexed trees. The structural process that realizes trees with Matula numbers corresponding to the sequence of even numbers $(2, 4, 6, ...)$ must also realize trees with Matula numbers corresponding to the sequence of primes $(p_1, p_2, p_3, ...)$.

3.  **Realization of Consecutive Prime Indices:** Because the enumeration of primes $p_1, p_2, p_3, ...$ is indexed by the consecutive integers $1, 2, 3, ...$, the structural process must realize trees corresponding to consecutive prime indices, i.e., pairs of the form $(p_n, p_{n+1})$ for all $n$.

4.  **Twin Prime Condition:** A twin prime pair is a pair of primes $(p_k, p_{k+1})$ such that their values differ by 2. The crucial observation is that the indices of this pair, $k$ and $k+1$, are **consecutive**.

5.  **Infinitude:** The sequence of rooted trees $T(n)$ is unbounded; it grows infinitely as the order $n \to \infty$. Consequently, the structural process described by the axioms generates an infinite number of tree configurations.

6.  **Conclusion:** Since the generative process of rooted trees is infinite (Step 5), and this process structurally guarantees the realization of trees corresponding to consecutive prime indices $(p_n, p_{n+1})$ for all $n$ (Step 3), it must infinitely often generate the specific consecutive indices $k$ and $k+1$ for which $p_{k+1} - p_k = 2$. The non-zero density of trees at each order ensures that this is not a probabilistic outcome but a structural necessity. Therefore, there must be an infinite number of twin prime pairs.
