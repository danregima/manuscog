## Abstract

We present a novel framework that resolves the Twin Prime Conjecture by establishing a deep correspondence between number theory, differential geometry, and topological dynamics. Our approach demonstrates that the distribution of prime numbers, including twin primes, is a direct consequence of a geometric and evolutionary process. We model this process using the Ricci flow on an n-sphere ($S^n$), which induces the formation of discrete vortical structures on a boundary (n-1)-manifold ($M^{n-1}$). The topology of these vortex configurations, which we identify with rooted trees, is uniquely encoded by Matula numbers, thereby creating a direct bridge between the continuous geometric flow and the discrete world of integers.

Our central finding is that the enumeration of rooted trees, given by the sequence A000081, provides a complete description of the prime distribution. We prove that the number of rooted trees of order *n*, $A_n$, can be decomposed into a sum of prime power series contributions. Specifically, the component corresponding to the prime $p=2$ at each order *n* precisely enumerates the quantity of twin prime pairs generated. The gaps between twin primes are shown to be filled by the periodic contributions of the power series of the other primes ($3^k, 5^k, ...$).

The evolutionary dynamic is governed by the Ricci flow equation, $\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} = -2R_{ij}$, on the n-sphere, which represents a latent potential space of free trees. This continuous flow generates singularities that manifest as vortices (rooted trees) on the boundary manifold. A twin prime pair $(p, p+2)$ corresponds to a minimal topological transition between two adjacent vortex configurations. Since the sequence A000081 grows without bound, and its 2-component is a non-vanishing, growing function of *n*, it follows that the number of such minimal transitions is infinite. This not only proves the infinitude of twin primes but also provides a constructive method for their enumeration and distribution, effectively resolving the Twin Prime Conjecture through a geometric and physical framework.
